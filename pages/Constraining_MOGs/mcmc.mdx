In order to perform the N-body simulations for modified cosmologies, we firstly need to constrain every single one of them with the use of various cosmological datasets to determine observables like $\Omega_{m0}$ or $H_0$ and derive the Hubble rate as well as effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm eff}$. In our case, we have used Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Supernovae type-Ia distance modulus, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) datasets to constrain our models. We provide those datasets in a form of a table below. 

The first dataset is OHD one:

| $z$  | $H(z)$   | $\sigma^2_H$ | $z$  | $H(z)$   | $\sigma^2_H$  | $z$  | $H(z)$ | $\sigma^2_H$ |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|
| $0.070$  | $69$   | $19.6$ | $0.3802$ | $83$   | $13.5$ | $0.8754$ | $125$   | $17$   |
| $0.090$  | $69$   | $12$   | $0.400$  | $95$   | $17$   | $0.880$  | $90$    | $40$   |
| $0.120$  | $68.6$ | $26.2$ | $0.4004$ | $77$   | $10.2$ | $0.900$  | $117$   | $23$   |
| $0.170$  | $83$   | $8$    | $0.4247$ | $87.1$ | $11.2$ | $1.037$  | $154$   | $20$   |
| $0.1791$ | $75$   | $4$    | $0.4497$ | $92.8$ | $12.9$ | $1.300$  | $168$   | $17$   |
| $0.1993$ | $75$   | $5$    | $0.4783$ | $80$   | $99$   | $1.363$  | $160$   | $33.6$ |
| $0.200$  | $72.9$ | $29.6$ | $0.480$  | $97$   | $62$   | $1.430$  | $177$   | $18$   |
| $0.270$  | $77$   | $14$   | $0.593$  | $104$  | $13$   | $1.530$  | $140$   | $14$   |
| $0.280$  | $88.8$ | $36.6$ | $0.6797$ | $92$   | $8$    | $1.750$  | $202$   | $40$   |
| $0.3519$ | $83$   | $14$   | $0.7812$ | $105$  | $12$   | $1.965$  | $186.5$ | $50.4$ |

And the second one refers to BAO:

| $z_{BAO}$                     | $0.106$          | $0.2$            | 0.35             | $0.44$          | $0.6$           | $0.73$          |
|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $\frac{d_{A}(z_*)}{D_{v}(z)}$ | $30.95 \pm 1.46$ | $17.55 \pm 0.60$ | $10.11 \pm 0.37$ | $8.44 \pm 0.67$ | $6.69 \pm 0.33$ | $5.45 \pm 0.31$ |

MCMC methodology usually tries to obtain a best fit for theoretical predictions of distance modulus, $H(z)$ by varying the values of input parameters within a given range. As a MCMC sample we have chosen the widely known one, namely [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Furtherly, we are going to discuss the results of such MCMC sampling for each modified gravity/neutrino case.

### Constraints for regular MOGs
First kind of modified theory of gravitation that we consider within the current project is modified symmetric teleparallel gravitation (or simply STEGR) with $f(Q)=Qe^{\lambda Q_0/Q}$, where $\lambda$ is a free model parameter and $Q_0=6H_0^2$. Second one is teleparallel gravitation, namely TEGR with $f(T)=T+\alpha T (1-e^{pT_0/T}-\sqrt{T_0/pT}\ln\left(T_0/T\right))$. We also include Non-Minimally Coupled versions of both theories with $f_1(Q)=Q+\alpha Q^2$, $f_2(Q)=1+\beta Q$ and $f_1(T)=T$, $f_2(T)=1+\lambda(T/T_0)^b$ respectively. The last model is Palatini-$f(R)$ gravitation, for which we have chosen the following functional form: $f(R)=R-2\Lambda/(\mu^2/R+1)$. We show the constraints for cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m0}$, $H_0$, $w_b$ and $M_B$ on the table below for each MOG of our consideration.

### Massive neutrino constraints
As we previously mentioned, apart from the regular case described in the subsection above, we also added massive neutrino species to our MOG models. This can be done by adding non-relativistic neutrino energy density to the total $\rho_{\rm m}$:
$$
    \rho_{\mathrm{m}} = \rho_{\mathrm{b}}+\rho_{\mathrm{c}}+\rho_{\mathrm{r}}+\rho_\nu
$$
Because of the fact that new species appear, we have also new contribution to the total mass density of the universe:
$$
    \Omega_\nu \approx \frac{m_\nu}{93.14 h^2 \mathrm{\;eV}}, \quad m_\nu = \sum_i m_{\nu_i}
$$
Constraints for all of the aforementioned cosmological parameters plus neutrino mass and effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ are placed on the table below as usual.
