title: About LANCELOT
---
LANCELOT is the library for the Large Scale Structure of the Universe, that implements various modified theories of gravitation, such as $f(Q)$, $f(T)$ and 
$f(T,B)$ gravities in the presence of massive neutrinos. Our library consists of 24 separate simulations:

- $f(Q)$ gravity with regular fluid, non-minimally coupled matter field and massive neutrinos $(1+1)\times2$ simulations
-  $f(T)$ gravity with regular fluid, non-minimally coupled matter field and massive neutrinos $(1+1)\times2$ simulations
-  Palatini-$f(R)$ gravity with regular fluid, massive neutrinos $2$ simulations

All aforementioned simulations are carried out with the box size $L_{\mathrm{box}}=1\mathrm{\;Gpc}/h$. However, it is planned to also investigate aforementioned theories of gravitation on the smaller scales with bigger resolution of separate galaxies and galaxy clusters (10 simulations in total). For that case, we assume $L_{\mathrm{box}}=100\mathrm{\;Mpc}/h$. Softening scales are redefined accordingly and resolution for each simulation is $(N_{\mathrm{p}})^{1/3}=1024$. The main goals of our project is to:

- Differentiate different novel modified theories of gravity, based on the teleparallelism or symmetric teleparallelism, Palatini formalism respectively, define whether those theories are  viable or not.
- Investigate and comparate the behaviour of previously mentioned MOG theories with both $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and $\nu\mathrm{CDM}$ theories. Constrain the parameter space for all three theories using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) approach, study Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, matter power spectrum $P(k)$ and bispectrum $B(k)$, 2PCF/3PCF and halo mass functions.

To determine the differences between aforementioned cosmologies, we firstly 
constrain our modified theories of gravity using OHD, Pantheon, BAO and CMB
datasets and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methodologies. We obtain constraints
on the additional degrees of freedom for each model of our consideration and 
upper bounds for total neutrino mass.
Consequently, we derive various cosmological observables, such as 1/2D matter power spectrum, two and three point correlation functions. Additionally, we train arificial neural network
to recover hydrodynamical physics, neutral hydrogen fields and investigate 
secondary CMB anisotropies, such as ISW and Rees-Sciama effects, kinematic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects. More detailed information can be found in the subsequent sections of this documentation.
