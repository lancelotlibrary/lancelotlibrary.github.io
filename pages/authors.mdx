LANCELOT is the library for the Large Scale Structure of the Universe, that implements various modified theories of gravitation, such as $f(Q)$, $f(T)$ and 
$f(T,B)$ gravities in the presence of massive neutrinos. Our library consists of 24 separate simulations:

- $f(Q)$ gravity with regular fluid, non-minimally coupled matter field and massive neutrinos $(1+1)\times2$ simulations
-  $f(T)$ gravity with regular fluid, non-minimally coupled matter field and massive neutrinos $(1+1)\times2$ simulations
-  Palatini-$f(R)$ gravity with regular fluid, massive neutrinos $(1+1)\times2$ simulations

All aforementioned simulations are carried out with the box size $L_{\mathrm{box}}=1\mathrm{\;Gpc}/h$. However, it is planned to also investigate aforementioned theories of gravitation on the smaller scales with bigger resolution of separate galaxies and galaxy clusters (12 simulations in total). For that case, we assume $L_{\mathrm{box}}=100\mathrm{\;Mpc}/h$. Softening scales are redefined accordingly and resolution for each simulation is $(N_{\mathrm{p}})^{1/3}=1024$. The main goals of our project is to:

- Differentiate different novel modified theories of gravity, based on the teleparallelism or symmetric teleparallelism, Palatini formalism respectively, define whether those theories are  viable or not.
- Investigate and comparate the behaviour of previously mentioned MOG theories with both $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and $\nu\mathrm{CDM}$ theories. Constrain the parameter space for all three theories using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) approach, study Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, matter power spectrum $P(k)$ and bispectrum $B(k)$, 2PCF/3PCF and halo mass functions.
